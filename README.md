# 🩺 Diabetic Retinopathy Detection System  
### Deep Learning Fundus Image Analysis for Early Detection of Diabetic Retinopathy

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a diabetes-related eye disease that can lead to vision loss or blindness if not detected early. Manual screening requires expert ophthalmologists and is time-consuming.

This project presents an **AI-powered web application** that uses **Deep Learning and Transfer Learning (Xception Model)** to automatically classify retinal fundus images into different stages of Diabetic Retinopathy.

The system provides an accessible, fast, and automated prediction mechanism through a Flask-based interface.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Early diagnosis of Diabetic Retinopathy is critical to prevent severe vision complications. Traditional diagnosis methods:

- Require medical expertise
- Are resource-intensive
- Cannot scale easily for mass screening

There is a need for an **automated, intelligent system** capable of analyzing retinal images efficiently.

---

## ✅ Proposed Solution

We developed a **Deep Learning based classification system** that:

✔ Analyzes retinal fundus images  
✔ Uses Transfer Learning (Xception) for feature extraction  
✔ Predicts DR severity stages  
✔ Provides results through a web interface  
✔ Logs predictions using IBM Cloudant Database
