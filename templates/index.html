    <h1>Diabetic Retinopathy Detection System</h1>

    <h3>Detailed Problem Statement</h3>
    <img class="grid-img" src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/projectDetailshome.jpg') }}"/>
    <p>
        Deep Learning Fundus Image Analysis for Early Detection of Diabetic Retinopathy
        is a medical imaging initiative aimed at leveraging advanced deep learning
        techniques to analyze retinal fundus images. Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is one
        of the leading causes of preventable blindness among diabetic patients
        worldwide. Early diagnosis is crucial, yet traditional manual screening
        requires expert ophthalmologists, significant time, and clinical resources.
    </p>

    <p>
        The increasing number of diabetic patients has created a pressing need for
        automated, accurate, and scalable diagnostic tools. Manual examination of
        fundus images is prone to variability, delayed diagnosis, and limited access
        in remote regions. Therefore, there is a critical demand for intelligent
        systems capable of detecting retinal abnormalities efficiently.
    </p>

    <h3>Real-World Application Scenarios</h3>

    <p><b>Scenario 1: Early Disease Detection</b><br>
        Healthcare professionals can use this system to identify early signs of
        Diabetic Retinopathy. The model assists clinicians by highlighting potential
        abnormalities, enabling timely intervention and monitoring.
    </p>

    <p><b>Scenario 2: Screening Programs</b><br>
        Hospitals and public health organizations can deploy the solution for
        large-scale screening of diabetic patients, improving diagnostic coverage
        and reducing workload on specialists.
    </p>

    <p><b>Scenario 3: Telemedicine & Remote Monitoring</b><br>
        Telemedicine platforms can integrate this model, allowing retinal images
        captured via portable devices to be analyzed remotely, ensuring accessibility
        for rural and underserved populations.
    </p>

    <h3>Proposed Solution</h3>

    <p>
        This project proposes a Deep Learning-based automated diagnostic system using
        a Transfer Learning approach with the Xception Convolutional Neural Network.
        The system processes retinal fundus images, extracts discriminative visual
        features, and classifies them into different stages of Diabetic Retinopathy.
    </p>

    <p>
        By utilizing pre-trained CNN architectures, the solution achieves high
        accuracy while reducing training complexity. The integrated Flask web
        application provides an intuitive user interface for image upload and
        prediction, while the IBM Cloudant Database ensures reliable storage and
        retrieval of user and prediction data.
